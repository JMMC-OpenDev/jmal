 Abstract:   A single class with clear, static entry points for
 hooking existing preferences, about, quit functionality
 from an existing Java app into handlers for the Mac OS X
 application menu.  Useful for developers looking to support
 multiple platforms with a single codebase, and support
 Mac OS X features with minimal impact.
